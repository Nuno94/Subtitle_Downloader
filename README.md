# Subtitle_Downloader
Python scrip that downloads subtitles for selected file. Built thinking about movies and TV shows.
Begginer level and tailored to my needs. Just a simple script without the need for many features and using some simple console interaction with the user.

It asks for the file and searches for the subtitles in thesubdb and opensubtitles databases. First searches are made using hash conversion and if that comes out empty or fails to provide satisfying results it then searches by the file name. In the meantime console interaction allows the user to control the flow of the script.

Thanks to thesubdb.com and opensubtitles.org for the contributions and the amazing API's.
